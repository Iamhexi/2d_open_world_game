Hey there! Ever get a cold with that big nose of yours?
Oh, all the time! But on the plus side, I can smell a pizza from three blocks away.
I bet you're the king of the 'sniff-test' when checking if food's still good?
Absolutely! But sometimes, I sneeze and accidentally launch the food across the room.
Well, at least you always know where the party's at with that crown of mini-noses!
You bet! But there's a downside. Why did I get uninvited from the buffet? Every time I sneezed, the party became a food-free zone!
